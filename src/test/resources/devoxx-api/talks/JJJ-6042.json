These applications run in stateless compute containers that are event-triggered, ephemeral (may only last for one invocation), and fully managed by a 3rd party. These functions can be triggered by a REST API call, scheduled timer, or another function. Static website hosting on Amazon Web Services S3, API Gateway for RESTful APIs, AWS Lambda for functions and Couchbase for persistence provide an ideal combination for deploying, managing and scaling your microservice. This talk will provide a quick introduction to each part of the stack. Then it will explain how a Serverless Application Model can be used to deploy different components of microservice. A path from your favorite IDE to a fully deployed and functional microservice will be shown with live coding.</p>\n",
